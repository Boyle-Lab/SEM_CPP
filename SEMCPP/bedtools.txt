bedtools will be used for the intersect function which will be comparing the 
	read and mergefile to identify .
	
	e.g. - "./bin/bedtools intersect -a $readfile -b $mergefile -wa -u | sort | uniq > $bedfile"
	
The -a option used in declaring the first bed file to be compared just as -b
	denotes that there will be a second file to compare with.

-wa will tell bedtools to write the original entry in the readfile for each 
	overlap.
	
The -u option tells bedtools to only write the original in A once for each 
	found overlap.
	
Identifies chromosones based upon chromosone name and final position, so if the 
	first and third elements of a line match it will print the specific chromosone 
	data.
	
Bed format has at a minimum three fields of chromosone name, starting position, 
	and end position but can have nine additional fields.
	
May be able to run or sorting algorithm that identifies the unique chromosones 
	based on the fields of matching string of chromosone name and end position 
	and if true print the first instance from the readfile.
	
Prints out unique chromosones which in our case would have to save them as part 
	of the struct but also be numerically/alphabetically sorted and checks again 
	repeats of lines.(Vector of strings most likely)
	
Actual sorting algorithm found in the intersectfile.cpp and the initialization of
	flags can be found in ContextIntersect.cpp file.
