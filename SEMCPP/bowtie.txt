how to work with bowtie?

main just processes the arguments, within main_bowtie.cpp
there is a "driver" function in ebwt_search.cpp, start there.
driver function takes six arguments, const char * type,
				     const string& ebwtFileBase,
				     const string& query,
				     const vector<string>& queries,
				     const vector<string>& qualities,
				     const string& outfile.
"type" is seemingly not used within driver
"ebwtFileBase" is some sort of name for a file

main seems to just set up bowtie, but ebwt_search.cpp actually
processes data and outputs whatever output

driver within ebwt_search.cpp is the "driver."
driver expects filenames.
part of driver is just processing the files

TODO: determine at what point the driver just performs computation,
      and pass directly before that

NOTE: there are variables mates1, mates2, mates12, and are global.
      these variables are seemingly important in some way to the driver.

      investigate line 2539 within ebwt_search.cpp, as to the meaning.

will interact with ebwt_search.cpp

readSequenceFile function is within sequence_io.h
