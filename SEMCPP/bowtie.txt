how to work with bowtie?

main just processes the arguments, within main_bowtie.cpp
there is a "driver" function in ebwt_search.cpp, start there.
driver function takes six arguments, const char * type,
				     const string& ebwtFileBase,
				     const string& query,
				     const vector<string>& queries,
				     const vector<string>& qualities,
				     const string& outfile.
"type" is seemingly not used within driver
"ebwtFileBase" is some sort of name for a file

main seems to just set up bowtie, but ebwt_search.cpp actually
processes data and outputs whatever output

driver within ebwt_search.cpp is the "driver."
driver expects filenames.
part of driver is just processing the files

TODO: will "redesign" int bowtie(int, const char**)

NOTE: stateful mode is off, I believe

      when running make, on current Makefile, there is a failed compilation
      as there is a similarly named library within the clang library on macOS

      this problem does not occur when compiling on Linux, as I compiled
      successfully within CAEN

      there are variables mates1, mates2, mates12, and are global.
      these variables are seemingly important in some way to the driver.

      investigate line 2522 within ebwt_search.cpp, as to the meaning.

will interact with ebwt_search.cpp

readSequenceFile function is within sequence_io.h

my $command = "./bin/bowtie --quiet -a -v 0 $GENOME -f $DNA_FA_FILE";
                      print results only, report all alignments per read,
                      report end-to-end hits with less than 0 mismatches.
                      what are genome and dna_fa_file?


questions
  what does adjustedEbwtFileBase(args) do?
    I think it just finds a correct filename to open
  what does readSequenceString(args) do?
    parses a comma-delimited list of strings of type T
    into a vector
  what does tokenize(args) do?
    according to description, just splits string given by argument
    according to given delimiter
    is too similar to readSequenceString, could be a typo for readSequenceString
